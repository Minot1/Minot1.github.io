# eCPPT Review 2024

## My background before eCPPT

First of all, I want to give you my background before I started to study for eCPPT. I have BSc Computer Science degree with experience of personal projects about software development and coding. So I am good at writing and understanding programming languages. I had a good knowledge of C++, Javascript, HTML-CSS, Python, SQL, and some knowledge of Java and bash. I had also experience with Windows and Unix environments.

Other than that, I always love solving machines from TryHackMe (THM) and HackTheBox (HTB). I had a quite experience in those sites as well (I will give more suggestions for specific machines later on). Moreover, a couple of months before studying for eCPPT, I obtained my eJPT certificate. So my hacking practical knowledge was also fresh.
